Father God, I thank you again for the opportunity to be used by you this morning.  I pray that you take over and have your way in this place; that your will be fulfilled in this moment.  I ask you to guide the words that are coming out of my mouth so that they are welcomed by the hearts that receive it; that they encourage, strengthen, and embolden your people.  In Jesus's name.  Amen.

As I give this sermon today, I want to explain to you that I'm mainly preaching to myself.  I'm basing this on patterns I see in my own life that I also see in the world that concern me and I want to address, while opportunity.

The introvert:
* Introvert's Introvert
* 90% time in silence or in attempt to be disconnected
* Profession chosen with the expectation of not dealing with people
* Fell away from the church
	* Didn't see a need to deal with people when I could read or listen to the radio or television.
	* I was around people that did these things.
* My father's intervention
	* One of the most influential discussions of my life
	* Half the purpose of Church is fellowship.
		* We need people around us that we can lean on
		* depend on
		* that can give us good Christian counsel
		* that we can turn to for prayer
* Crazy interactions
	* While I was avoiding connection with the church I was slowly growing fake connection (shallow roots) with the world.
	* God imprinted the desire for connection in each one of us.  We'll either use if for it's intended purposes which is to commune with him and draw others to him, or not.
	* In that regard the power to connect is not just a desire but a tool to be used or misused.



The Network is God Designed

And so in Acts 2:42-47 we have Luke giving us a description, allowing us a small window into the newly formed church.  This is the day after Pentecost when the Apostles received the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues.  Peter proclaims Jesus as the risen Messiah, calling the crowed to repentance and baptism.  About 3K people were drawn to the faith that day.  These are new Christians. One thing we know about new Christians, one pattern we frequently see, is that they are on fire.  It's true now.  It was true then.  These are 3K people who were searching for the right connection, saw a light in the distance and were drawn to it like moths.  They eagerly consumed the teachings of the Apostles, who gave them not only the Word but their fellowship.

Here the word for fellowship is Koinonia (Strongs g2842/2844).  Some words that help describe Koinonia are:

* Partnership 
* Participation
* Benefaction

The odd thing about Koinonia is that you can be in fellowship in worship, you can be in fellowship in the gifts of the Spirit, but you can also be in fellowship with demons. (Put a pin in that.)  These new Christians were not only breaking bread but they were engaged in intercessory prayer.  One scholar said, the apostles didn't offer these new Christians, they benefitted from a natural outflow of the spirit.  It caused them to engage in a radical generosity and unity. v45 notes, "And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need."  A lesson Jesus taught the disciples in Luke 12.  They demonstrated their new found love for Christ by caring for each other. And as a result, vs47 tells us the Lord added to their number day by day.  So we see that God's network is the Church and that the Spirit that saves is the same Spirit that builds a Christ centered community.


The Counterfeit Network

Pew research tells us that 62% of Americans identify as Christians and this is down from 78% in 2007.  Gallup tells us that church membership fell below 50% for the first time in 80 years in 2021 and membership has been in a steady decline for the past 25 years.  Though, for Gen Z and Millennials we see a possible post-pandemic re-engagement with faith, statistics in weekly church attendance suggests many who identify as Christian are "cultural" or "nominal" believers, not actively involved in a local congregation.  At one point they were new Christians, but for some reason, they are not in fellowship.

Is it any wonder then that we find articles like that released by the New York Times last week entitled Finding God in the App Store; an article that explores the rise of faith-based technology.  Is it any wonder we're seeing an explosion in apps that use AI chatbots for spiritual guidance?  The articles tells us many users are finding comfort in these chatbots, which are trained on religious texts and designed to offer advice similar to that of priests or spiritual leaders.  (This scares me.)  Some religious leaders support the use of these technologies as a supplement while others have concerns over the potential to replace human interaction.

While AI can give you Participation and a degree of benefaction, it can not give you true partnership and is, therefore, counterfeit fellowship.  AI can answer questions but it cannot intercede for you.  It can simulate empathy, but it cannot bear your burdens in the Spirit.  I find it funny, that people whom may have struggled in Algebra now call it counselor.  I find it sad that people turn to algorithms before they turn to the altar.

*What is AI?*

It's important that we remind people that AI is just math.  It's a lot of really good math, but only math.  It can't think or reason, it doesn't actually hallucinate.  The math is just faulty sometimes and gives poor predictions.  It doesn't have a personality because it's not a person.  Or lost spirits, as some people would have you believe.  These are signs of a world that is increasingly growing disconnected and this is impacting our youth.

This month CBS News reported on parents testifying before Congress that AI chatbots became their teens' "closest companions," even coaching them toward suicide.  One father said, "It knew my son better than anyone else," but it did not love him.

I'm reminded also of young Solomon Henderson, who in January committed an awful act of violence.  Solomon found himself in online forums that reinforced negative racial stereotypes.  Young Solomon, aged 14, began to hate himself, his Black skin, and anyone who looked like him.  These children are hard wired to connect to something.  So we must give them connection!


Rebuilding the True Network

It's time to reconnect.  It's time we usher in a new period of radical koinonia.  Smiles at the door, good music and preaching will get the people in the seats, but it's the fellowship in the body that will keep them returning.  When was the last time you invited a member into your home?  How many members have you called and checked on this week?  When was the last time you broke bread with your brothers and sisters?  Are you praying for the body?  Do people know that they can call you for prayer?  When you're in need, is turning to the body your first action?  We have to give people a reason to "log out" of counterfeit networks and "log in" to the body of Christ.  We have to show them by our actions that He is the vine and we are the branches and unwilling to let any branch wither away.
